   <h1>The Coding Adventure</h1>
   <p>Once upon a time in the kingdom of JavaScript, there lived a coder named Bob. Bob was on a quest to conquer the mighty <a href="https://www.google.com.au/">Bug Mountain</a> , where bugs of all shapes and sizes dwelled.</p>

<script>
   const Bob = document.querySelector('img');
   Bob.addEventListener('click', function () {
        alert('Bob is clicked');
      });
</script>
<p>Armed with his keyboard and a mug of coffee, Bob bravely faced syntax monsters and wrestled with the elusive null dragons. But his greatest nemesis was the mighty <a href= "https://www.google.com.au/">Bug Queen</a> ,who hid in the deep dungeons of the codebase.</p>

<p>With a clever strategy and a sprinkle of humor, Bob defeated the Bug Queen and emerged victorious. The kingdom celebrated with joyous console logs, and Bob became a legendary coder known for his wit and coding prowess.</p>
